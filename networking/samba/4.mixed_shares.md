## Mixed Authenticated and Guest access
Note: This method has quirks

Example:
- share your Documents directory
- Only you can write
- guests can read

```
[Documents]
    path = /home/fred/Documents
    writeable = yes
    guest ok = yes
    create mask = 644
    write list = fred
```

File permissions - guest must be able to "traverse the file system" to the shared directory
```
chmod o+rx /home/fred
chmod o+rx /home/fred/Documents
```

### Issues with "Mixed" Access
You're on Windows:
- You click on the share
- It immediately connects you as guest, read-only
- You never got a chance to enter a user and password.

To fix this:
- "Map network drive"
- select "Connect using different credentials"

## Hiding a share
- set `browseable = no`
- share can only be accessed explicitly with `\\hostname\share` (Windows)
or `smb://hostname/share` (Linux)
