# Installation
Install the **samba** and **wsdd** packages using your package manager. For example:

    sudo apt install samba wsdd

For Windows 7 and later clients, we don't need the nmbd service.

    sudo systemctl stop nmbd.service
    sudo systemctl disable nmbd.service

## Base Configuration
Stop samba service, backup the default config file, edit `smb.conf`.

    sudo systemctl stop smbd.service
    cd /etc/samba
    sudo mv smb.conf smb.conf.orig
    sudo nano smb.conf

Put the following:
```
[global]
    map to guest = Bad User
```

Test the configuration for syntax errors:
```
testparm
```

Restart Samba and related services:
```
sudo systemctl restart smbd.service wsdd.service
```

## How to create or modify shares

```
sudo nano /etc/samba/smb.conf
```

Paste in share defintion(s), edit as needed  
Put blank lines between share definitions.  
Save file. Then test configuration for syntax errors and restart Samba:
```
testparm && sudo systemctl restart smbd.service
```

## Notes

**map to guest = Bad User**
- This directive maps guests to the "nobody" user. (it's an actual user, see /etc/passwd)
- It does not actually enable guest access.
- Guest access can be enabled in share definitions
