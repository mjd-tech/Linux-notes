# Toggle Samba on/off
run Samba only when you need it. Useful if you have a read/write guest share that you don't
want to leave running all the time.

```
# Disable Samba from starting automatically
sudo systemctl disable smbd.service

# Start Samba when you need it:
sudo systemctl start smbd.service

# Stop Samba when you're done:
sudo systemctl stop smbd.service
```

You can also use a bash script to toggle Samba on or off:

/home/fred/.local/bin/togglesmb

```bash
#!/bin/bash
# Toggle Samba file sharing on or off

status=$( systemctl is-active smbd.service )

echo "Samba file sharing is ${status^^}"

if [[ $status == inactive ]]; then
	echo "Turn it on? (y/n)"
    read -srn1
    if [[ $REPLY =~ [yY] ]]; then 
	    echo "Starting Samba file sharing..."
        sudo systemctl start smbd.service
    else
        exit
    fi
else
    echo "Turn it off? (y/n)"
    read -srn1
    if [[ $REPLY =~ [yY] ]]; then
        echo "Stopping Samba file sharing..."
        sudo systemctl stop smbd.service
    else
        exit
    fi
fi
status=$( systemctl is-active smbd.service )
echo
echo "Samba file sharing is ${status^^}"
echo "Press any key to continue..."
read -srn1
```
