# Users and Groups
Users and groups are used to control access to files, directories, and peripherals.

## Examples
Which groups am I in?
    groups

What's my user ID
    id  # also displays group info

Add fred to vboxusers group
    sudo usermod -G vboxusers -a fred

Add new user, Debian-based systems. Runs an interactive "wizard"
    sudo adduser barney

Add new user, Arch-based systems
    # Creates and populates homedir, shell = bash, primary group same name as user
    sudo useradd barney
    
    # With fullname, shell =zsh, add to vboxusers and wheel groups.
    sudo useradd -m -c "Barney Rubble" -s /bin/zsh -G vboxusers,wheel barney
    
    # Set password for new user (recommended)
    sudo passwd barney

Add new system user "foo", no homedir, no login
    sudo useradd --system --shell=/usr/sbin/nologin foo
    # shell may be /usr/bin/nologin. check /etc/password for examples

Delete user
    sudo userdel -r barney

## Primary group
- Typically, when you create new user barney, a new group named barney is created.
- This group becomes the "primary group" for barney
- files created by barney are owned by barney:barney
- On a NAS, typically all users primary group is "users", to facilitate file sharing.
